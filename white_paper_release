\begin{abstract}
\projectname{} is a decentralized and immutable message board system on the Ethereum blockchain where users can post messages and media files. Storage of those messages is handled via IPFS and a smart contract is used to store a ledger of all messages. A Proof of Stake style mechanism ensures quality content and protects the system against spam, while also incentivising users to stake their Ether. The immutable and decentralized nature of the system allows for free speech and gives way to create truly censorship resistant and self sustaining platforms.

\section{What \projectname{} is}
Like many other dApps \projectname{} consists of a website that interfaces with a smart contract. The contract serves as a decentralized ledger to write to and read from while larger chunks of data are stored on the decentralized IPFS network. The smart contract and the storage is decentralized, the website however is not. Users can clone or fork the website repository and set up another interface by themselves and either host it for others to use as well or run it on a local webserver for themselves.

By crafting the necessary transaction data themselves, users could also send messages directly to the smart contract through the use of tools like MyEtherWallet or Etherscan or even command line interfaces. There is no way to restrict a user from sending messages to the contract.

The messages sent to the system usually consist of at least a short or long comment made by the user, an optional subject and optional media attachments. This allows users to freely express their thoughts, discuss various topics and engage with ongoing discussions or start new ones. All of this happens free from censorship by government or other authorities.

\section{What IPFS is}
IPFS, or the ``InterPlanetary FileSystem'' is a self described peer-to-peer hypermedia protocol to make the web faster, safer, and more open.

It relies on users operating so called nodes to distribute server load and content storage across multiple machines with a certain level of redundancy.

Nodes will keep stored content as long as the node has it pinned. If content gets unpinned it will be purged from the node once no more requests for that content are made to preserve storage space. Users can set up their own nodes and require them to replicate data from another node they specify. That way a network can be established with redundancy.

Users can interact with IPFS either through the use of a command line interface, desktop or mobile applications, or by using web interfaces.

More on IPFS can be read in their own whitepaper\footnote{IPFS Whitepaper https://github.com/ipfs/papers/raw/master/ipfs-cap2pfs/ipfs-p2p-file-system.pdf}.
